Sudoku-web-version
==================

## Week 5 Project @ Makers Academy

The goal was to use the [Sudoku solver engine](https://github.com/duboff/sudoku) to build a simple Sinatra sudoku web app.

The app was written before I learned Bootstrap and is thus not very strong on the front end, particularly not very responsive.

The project does not include any integration tests, only unit tests for the game itself as we did the project before learning Capybara.
